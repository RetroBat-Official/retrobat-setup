### New method (RetroBuild.exe):

The program RetroBuild.exe has been created to facilitate the build of RetroBat.

1) Download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) (follow default setup settings).

2) In your target folder where you want to build:
- either open CMD Windows Terminal and run the following commands to clone recursively the RetroBat git with its submodules and run build.bat to launch the build:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RetroBat-Official/retrobat-setup.git
```
- or use github desktop to clone the retrobat-setup repository

3) Open the build.ini file with your favorite text editor to define build options

4) Run RetroBuild.exe to build RetroBat

5) Run option 1 first and wait until the process is finished

6) Run option 2 or 3 to create either a zip package, either the setup executable
   
7) Once the build process is done, you will find the RetroBat Setup in the build directory.
