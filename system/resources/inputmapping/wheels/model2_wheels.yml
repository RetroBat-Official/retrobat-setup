# This file is provided with RetroBat
#
# It can be used to automatically generate Mapping automatically for your wheel in Model2 emulator.
# Each container must be named with the wheel type internal to RetroBat (see our wiki for the list)
# The elements listed are the buttons that will be mapped in the emulator
# The key represents the wheel button (with some exceptions) : use the LogitechG29 entry as example
# The value represents the Model2 button code to put in the emulator .input file
# Model 2 input file is a binary file, RetroBat will convert the button IDs and override the binary file
#
# Use the DeportedShifter value ONLY for some Thrustmaster devices where the Gear Stick is identified as a separate device.
# 
# If your throttle, brake or steering axis are reversed, you can use "axisinv" instead of axis before the axis ID, 
# this will effectively reverse the axis in the mapping
#
# Usual values for most common wheels are:
# axis0 for steering
# axis1 and axis2 for throttle and brake
# ButtonID vary greatly depending on the wheel model
