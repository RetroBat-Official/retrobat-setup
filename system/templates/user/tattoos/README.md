# retrobat-user tattoos

This directory can be used to add you own tattoos.

You can add per game tattoos in the \games subfolder, eg: \games\snes\Super Mario World.png"
Always use the name of the rom file of your game for the png image, and use a subfolder for the system.

You can place more generic tattoos per system in the \default folder.
The tattoo must be named <system>.png, for example atari2600.png.

Tattoos are only shown when bezels are enabled.
